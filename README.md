# Euroschool App
The project's title is self-explanatory - this is an app for the Euroschool - European School of Luxembourg.

Specifically it is a cross-platform app that students can use whether on Android or iOS to access many of the school's services in one convenient place instead of going through tens of different websites as usual.
